#### Breaking do Ver√£o
##### Official website of a breaking championship.
**The challenge:** create a themed and inviting website to promote the event and attract participants to the championship.

**The solution:** I used graffiti graphics, one of the elements of hip hop culture, to create a layout with an urban look. In this project I created a widget for Elementor that displays elements with an image mask.
